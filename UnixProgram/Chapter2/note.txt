g++ add.c sub.c -c
# add.o sub.o

ar csr libmymath.a add.o sub.o
# get static library
# c - create
# s - make a index ???
# r - replace ???

g++ test.cpp ./lib/libmymath.a -I ./inc -o test

==============================

In language has implicit declaration, which means int add(int,int);
but in cpp doesn't have, so we need the mymath.h(only declaration), and have to include "mymath"
